# Out-of-Sight

## About
A simple horror platformer that follows a little girl as she tries to escape a seemingly never-ending house of repeating hallways, memories, and maybe something a little sinister.
- I made a YouTube demo of the game! Click [here](https://youtu.be/wUkGteWnN54?si=GXYI7mDVulGaX-jH) for the video.

## History
Was first created for grade 10 final project in 2021, and has been updated throughout the years, adding lore and optimizing code. Uploaded to GitHub October 2024 (because my profile was so dry and I need to prepare for co-op applications and my favourite project isn't even on here).

## Credit

- Black-and-white silhouette art and the playstyle are inspired by Limbo by Playdead.
